<h1>Kayla Harris</h1>

<p>You are viewing my personal website!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Kayla Harris and I'm a recent graduate of UAB's Information Systems program. I also completed a minor in Computer Science there. 
I'm currently working as a contract mainframe developer for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama. 
Right now, I'm just seeing how I like it, as it's a very interesting field to get into.
On the side, I'm a co-director is the Women Who Code Birmingham chapter and I work on little side projects. Those projects will show up
on here eventually, so be on the lookout!</p>
